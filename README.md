## How to start?

Simply, first make sure that you have Node and React Native installed alongside specific development tools needed for each platform you want to build this project for ( Java and Android Studio for Android for example ). Then, when your development environment is ready, run the following in the terminal:

```
$ npm i
$ npm run <android | ios>
```

## How does it work?

It utilizes simple algorithm that calculates the frequency given from the live audio stream. This frequency essentially can be directly translated into notes and rendered onto the screen.
